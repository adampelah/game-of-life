# game of life

hello adam --> these are some notes on the current state of the project since the date and time this was pushed

1) the visualization seems to be functional... however, if we are gonna add deathrate, and charectoristics such as age
  we are gonna need a more robust means of visualization. I think matplot is good, but the cells are hard to keep track of
  
2) I think we could also use matplot to create a graph of the data, that way we can help visualize the rate of infection and death reate
